 * This object represents the CPU.
 * It contains all the registers and memory.
 * It also contains the stack and the stack pointer.
 * It also contains the current position in memory.
 * It also contains the current opcode.
 * It also contains the current instruction.
 * It also contains the current instruction's parameters.
 * It also contains the current instruction's parameter types.
 * It also contains the current instruction's parameter count.
 *
 * The CPU is the heart of the emulator.
 * It is the main object that is responsible for executing instructions.
 *
 * The CPU is responsible for:
 * - Reading the opcode from memory.
 * - Reading the parameters from memory.
 * - Executing the instruction.
 * - Writing the result to memory.
 * - Writing the result to the screen.
 * - Writing the result to the stack.

 *
 * ## Opcodes
 *
 * CHIP-8 has 35 opcodes, which are all two bytes long and stored Big-ending.
 *
 * ### Symbol Table
 *
 * The symbols in the Opcode column of the Opcode table can be interpreted as follows:
 *8 * | Symbol | Explanation |
 * -------- | -------------
 * | NNN | address |
 * | NN | 8-bit constant |
 * | N | 4-bit constant |
 * | X | 4-bit register identifier |
 * | Y | 4-bit register identifier |
 * | PC | Program Counter |
 * | I | 16bit register (For memory address) (Similar to void pointer) |
 * | VN | One of the 16 available variables. N may be 0 to F (hexadecimal) |
 *
 * ### Opcode Table
 *
 * The table below lists the 35 CHIP-8 opcodes in hexadecimal.
 *
 * Of these opcodes, **1/35** are currently implemented in chip
 * (Emoji denote implementation status.)
 *
 * | Implemented | Opcode | Explanation |
 * -------- | -------------
 * |ðŸŒ±| 0000 | Returns the program.
 * || 00E0 | Clears the screen.
 * || 00EE | Returns from a subroutine.
 * || 0NNN | Calls RCA 1802 program at address NNN. Not necessary for most ROMs.
 * || 1NNN | Jumps to address NNN.
 * || 2NNN | Calls subroutine at NNN.
 * || 3XNN | Skips the next instruction if VX equals NN.
 * || 4XNN | Skips the next instruction if VX doesn't equal NN.
 * || 5XY0 | Skips the next instruction if VX equals VY.
 * || 6XNN | Sets VX to NN.
 * || 7XNN | Adds NN to VX.
 * || 8XY0 | Sets VX to the value of VY.
 * || 8XY1 | Sets VX to VX or VY.
 * || 8XY2 | Sets VX to VX and VY.
 * || 8XY3 | Sets VX to VX xor VY.
 * |ðŸŒ±| 8XY4 | Adds VY to VX. VF is set to 1 when there's a carry, and to 0 when there isn't.
 * || 8XY5 | VY is subtracted from VX. VF is set to 0 when there's a borrow, and 1 when there isn't.
 * || 8XY6 | Shifts VX right by one. VF is set to the value of the least significant bit of VX before the shift.
 * || 8XY7 | Sets VX to VY minus VX. VF is set to 0 when there's a borrow, and 1 when there isn't.
 * || 8XYE | Shifts VX left by one. VF is set to the value of the most significant bit of VX before the shift.|
 * || 9XY0 | Skips the next instruction if VX doesn't equal VY.
 * || ANNN | Sets I to the address NNN.
 * || BNNN | Jumps to the address NNN plus V0.
 * || CXNN | Sets VX to the result of a bitwise and operation on a random number and NN.
 * || DXYN | Sprites stored in memory at location in index register (I), 8bits wide. Wraps around the screen. If when drawn, clears a pixel, register VF is set to 1 otherwise it is zero. All drawing is XOR drawing (i.e. it toggles the screen pixels). Sprites are drawn starting at position VX, VY. N is the number of 8bit rows that need to be drawn. If N is greater than 1, second line continues at position VX, VY+1, and so on.
 * || EX9E | Skips the next instruction if the key stored in VX is pressed.
 * || EXA1 | Skips the next instruction if the key stored in VX isn't pressed.
 * || FX07 | Sets VX to the value of the delay timer.
 * || FX0A | A key press is awaited, and then stored in VX.
 * || FX15 | Sets the delay timer to VX.
 * || FX18 | Sets the sound timer to VX.
 * || FX1E | Adds VX to I. |
 * || FX29 | Sets I to the location of the sprite for the character in VX. Characters 0-F (in hexadecimal) are represented by a 4x5 font.
 * || FX33 | Stores the Binary-coded decimal representation of VX, with the most significant of three digits at the address in I, the middle digit at I plus 1, and the least significant digit at I plus 2. (In other |words, take the decimal representation of VX, place the hundreds digit in memory at location in I, the tens digit at location I+1, and the ones digit at location I+2.)
 * || FX55 | Stores V0 to VX in memory starting at address I.
 * || FX65 | Fills V0 to VX with values from memory starting at address I.
 * |ðŸŒ±| _ | Panic.

# chip implements [CHIP-8 Virtual Machine - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8#Virtual_machine_description)

chip was developed using

- Rust In Action chapter 5 program to implement initial cpu, run, call, and opcodes for `[0000,00EE,2NNN,8XY4,_]`.
- [CHIP-8 Virtual Machine Description [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8#Virtual_machine_description)

## Setup

- install rust >=1.59 (or enable nightly/feature(destructuring_assignment))
- clone repository
- cargo run

## Opcodes

CHIP-8 has 35 opcodes, which are all two bytes long and stored Big-ending.

### Symbol Table

More information about CHIP-8 can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).

## Installation

Since the program is provided as source, you will need to compile it to your target platform. Therefore, you need to have a fully working installation of [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/). Once the program is compiled, you can run it from the command prompt without the need to install it. See the next section for usage instructions.

## Rust Nightly Development

This feature is experimental and requires nightly channel.
[https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2909-destructuring-assignment.html]
[https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/372]0
Nightly must include: rls, rust-src, rust-analysis
Sometimes nightly doesn't always build these components.
Check here for latest status: [https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-toolstate/]
Or check here: [https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup-components-history/]
For instance, on 2021-01-10, the most recent time rls built in nightly was on 2021-12-05, and so:
"rust-client.channel": "nightly-2021-12-05",

## Usage

chip reads an input file containing the program to be run on the virtual machine.
To launch a program, type the following instruction from the command prompt.

```bash
chip8 [PATH_TO_CHIP8_FILE]
```

## Licensing

Please see the file called [LICENSE](LICENSE.md).

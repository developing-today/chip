## Opcodes

CHIP-8 has 35 opcodes, which are all two bytes long and stored Big-ending.

### Symbol Table

The symbols in the Opcode column of the Opcode table can be interpreted as follows:

| Symbol | Explanation |
-------- | -------------
| NNN | address |
| NN | 8-bit constant |
| N | 4-bit constant |
| X | 4-bit register identifier |
| Y | 4-bit register identifier |
| PC | Program Counter |
| I | 16bit register (For memory address) (Similar to void pointer) |
| VN | One of the 16 available variables. N may be 0 to F (hexadecimal) |

### Opcode Table

The table below lists the 35 CHIP-8 opcodes in hexadecimal.

Of these opcodes, **1/35** are currently implemented in chip
(Emoji denote implementation status.)

| Implemented | Opcode | Explanation |
-------- | -------------
|ðŸŒ±| 0000 | Returns the program. |
|| 00E0 | Clears the screen. |
|| 00EE | Returns from a subroutine. |
|| 0NNN | Calls RCA 1802 program at address NNN. Not necessary for most ROMs. |
|| 1NNN | Jumps to address NNN. |
|| 2NNN | Calls subroutine at NNN. |
|| 3XNN | Skips the next instruction if VX equals NN. |
|| 4XNN | Skips the next instruction if VX doesn't equal NN. |
|| 5XY0 | Skips the next instruction if VX equals VY. |
|| 6XNN | Sets VX to NN. |
|| 7XNN | Adds NN to VX. |
|| 8XY0 | Sets VX to the value of VY. |
|| 8XY1 | Sets VX to VX or VY. |
|| 8XY2 | Sets VX to VX and VY. |
|| 8XY3 | Sets VX to VX xor VY. |
|ðŸŒ±| 8XY4 | Adds VY to VX. VF is set to 1 when there's a carry, and to 0 when there isn't. |
|| 8XY5 | VY is subtracted from VX. VF is set to 0 when there's a borrow, and 1 when there isn't. |
|| 8XY6 | Shifts VX right by one. VF is set to the value of the least significant bit of VX before the shift. |
|| 8XY7 | Sets VX to VY minus VX. VF is set to 0 when there's a borrow, and 1 when there isn't. |
|| 8XYE | Shifts VX left by one. VF is set to the value of the most significant bit of VX before the shift.|
|| 9XY0 | Skips the next instruction if VX doesn't equal VY. |
|| ANNN | Sets I to the address NNN. |
|| BNNN | Jumps to the address NNN plus V0. |
|| CXNN | Sets VX to the result of a bitwise and operation on a random number and NN. |
|| DXYN | Sprites stored in memory at location in index register (I), 8bits wide. Wraps around the screen. If when drawn, clears a pixel, register VF is set to 1 otherwise it is zero. All drawing is XOR drawing (i.e. |it toggles the screen pixels). Sprites are drawn starting at position VX, VY. N is the number of 8bit rows that need to be drawn. If N is greater than 1, second line continues at position VX, VY+1, and so on. |
|| EX9E | Skips the next instruction if the key stored in VX is pressed. |
|| EXA1 | Skips the next instruction if the key stored in VX isn't pressed. |
|| FX07 | Sets VX to the value of the delay timer. |
|| FX0A | A key press is awaited, and then stored in VX. |
|| FX15 | Sets the delay timer to VX. |
|| FX18 | Sets the sound timer to VX. |
|| FX1E | Adds VX to I.</sup> |
|| FX29 | Sets I to the location of the sprite for the character in VX. Characters 0-F (in hexadecimal) are represented by a 4x5 font. |
|| FX33 | Stores the Binary-coded decimal representation of VX, with the most significant of three digits at the address in I, the middle digit at I plus 1, and the least significant digit at I plus 2. (In other |words, take the decimal representation of VX, place the hundreds digit in memory at location in I, the tens digit at location I+1, and the ones digit at location I+2.) |
|| FX55 | Stores V0 to VX in memory starting at address I.</sup> |
|| FX65 | Fills V0 to VX with values from memory starting at address I.</sup> |
|ðŸŒ±| _ | Panic. |

## Installation

Since the program is provided as source, you will need to compile it to your target platform. Therefore, you need to have a fully working installation of [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/). Once the program is compiled, you can run it from the command prompt without the need to install it. See the next section for usage instructions.

## Usage

chip reads an input file containing the program to be run on the virtual machine.
To launch a program, type the following instruction from the command prompt.

```bash
chip8 [PATH_TO_CHIP8_FILE]
```

## Licensing

Please see the file called [LICENSE](LICENSE.md).
